            It all started one night when Leon Stivers, a young<br/> 
            design engineer with a passion for both science and<br/> 
            cinema, was rewatching a cult movie about the future.<br/>
            On the screen, the characters glided through cities<br/>
            with neon, wore high-tech devices and looked like they<br/>
            came from another era. It dawned on Leon, <br/>
            “Why hasn't the world of professional sports yet absorbed this aesthetic of the future?<br/>
             Why can't technology that seems like science fiction become a reality now?”<br/>
            <br/>  
            Leon decided to combine his passions: sport,<br/>
            technology and design to create not just eyewear, but<br/>
            the perfect symbiosis of utility, futuristic style and innovation.<br/>
            This is how YOGLASSES was born.<br/>A name that promised the user a vision of the world through the prism of the future.
